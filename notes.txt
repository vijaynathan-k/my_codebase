Adding, JSON for Modern C++ (nlohmann/json)
================================================
* https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
* Add it as subtree to your project
** git subtree add --prefix third-party/json https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git master --squash
** When you run git subtree add, Git automatically creates a merge commit. 
** Because the changes are already "committed" to your local history, they will not show up in the "Changes" or "Staged Changes" list.
** How to verify: Look at your Git Graph or run git log in the terminal. You should see a new commit titled "Add '' from commit ''".    
* These libraries consist only of .hpp files. You don't "build" them; you just point to their location.
* How to use (CMakeLists.txt):
* cmake file
    # Header-only libraries usually provide an 'interface' target
    add_subdirectory(external/json)
    target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)
* C++ Code (in cpp file):
    #include <nlohmann/json.hpp>
    using json = nlohmann::json;
    // No linking required, just include and go!
